model_simulations
=================

This is a large project where a colleague (Andrew Bray) and I are composing simulations of  economic models for introductory and
intermediate economics courses. We hope to provide a variety of models both for 'mainstream' and 'heterodox' economics. 

Isoquant Model:
The first model provided here is a standard isoquant and isocost model based on producer theory based on a constant returns to 
scale Cobb-Douglas production technology and a linear isocost curve.
